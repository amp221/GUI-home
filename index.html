            About Me: I am a student pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and
            currently hold a degree is in Fine Arts Painting.  When I'm not behind
            a computer screen you can find me cooking or exploring new places.
            My time isn't really spent painting anymore but instead, I choose to apply
            some of the underlying concepts to whatever project I'm working on.
            I have an interested in all types of design.  I believe that aesthetics
            play a large role in contributing to peoples quality of life.  This class
            has given me the opportunity to merge both of my interests.
